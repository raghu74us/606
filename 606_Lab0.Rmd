## Lab 0

The Data: Dr. Arbuthnotâ€™s Baptism Records

```{r E1}

source("http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/arbuthnot.R")

arbuthnot
dim(arbuthnot)
names(arbuthnot)

#What command would you use to extract just the counts of girls baptized? 

# counts of girls baptized by year
arbuthnot$girls

# total counts of girls baptized
sum(arbuthnot$girls)

```

## Plots

```{r E2}

plot(x = arbuthnot$year, y = arbuthnot$girls)
plot(x = arbuthnot$year, y = arbuthnot$girls, type = "l")

#Is there an apparent trend in the number of girls baptized over the years?
#How would you describe it?

#Yes. Girls baptized has increased from period 1660 to 1700.

```

## Plots

```{r E3}
# Now, make a plot of the proportion of boys over time. What do you see? 
tot <- arbuthnot$boys + arbuthnot$girls
bp <- arbuthnot$boys / tot
gp <- arbuthnot$girls / tot

plot(x = arbuthnot$year, y = bp, col="blue" , type = "l", 
xlab="Year", ylab="Proportion", main="Proportion of Boys over time" )

abline(lm(bp ~ arbuthnot$year))

plot(x = arbuthnot$year, y = gp, col="red" , type = "l", 
     xlab="Year", ylab="Proportion", main="Proportion of Girls over time")

abline(lm(gp ~ arbuthnot$year))

```

Proportion of Boys decreases over a period of time where as Proportion of girls increases over period of time.

### Data Preparation

```{r s1, include=TRUE}

yr_2013 <- read.csv(file = ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raghu74us/606/master/2013_shooter.csv"),sep =",")

#not including the columns that are not needed for analysis.
yr_2013 <- yr_2013[ , c('date', 'killed', 'wounded', 'location')]
     #split state and city based on location
     str(yr_2013)

     #Add month and year based on date.

### Research question

Is mass shooting predictable in a State based on the prior data  ?.
I will be using 2013 data for analysis. 

### Cases
What are the cases, and how many are there?

Each case represents a City and State in the united states. There observations in the given data set.

##Data collection
###Describe the method of data collection.

Data is available in Buzfeed News. There are data files for each year from 2013 to 2015.


##Type of study
###What type of study is this (observational/experiment)?

This study is observational.

##Data Source

Data is available under the below link.
https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2015-12-mass-shooting-intervals/tree/master/data

##Response
###What is the response variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorical)?

Response variable is the number of  incidents in a month in a city, State. It is numerical. 


##Explanatory
###What is the explanatory variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorival)?

Number of incidents each month. Has the incidents happened each month what is the count of it.
This need to be done for atleast 3 years to decide which city has highest incident and the reoccurrence chances each month. 

###Relevant summary statistics
Provide summary statistics relevant to your research question. For example, if youâ€™re comparing means across groups provide means, SDs, sample sizes of each group. This step requires the use of R, hence a code chunk is provided below. Insert more code chunks as needed.


```{r s2, include=TRUE}

summary(yr_2013_df2_inc$total_incidents)
summary(yr_2013_df2_kw$killed+yr_2013_df2_kw$wounded)
table(yr_2013_df2_inc$total_incidents)
table(yr_2013_df2_kw$killed)
table(yr_2013_df2_kw$wounded)

# I will be using the average(mean) number of incidents by State in 2013  which can be compared with multiple years. Similarly, will be using the average number of people killed + wounded by State in 2013 for comparison with 2014 and 2015.
